First, you have the "Wellcome Page", just a simple page with a play button;
Seccond, you have the config page, there is where you will configure the game, selecting how much time per draw and how much words each player will write;
Third, you have to set your words to be used at the game;
Finally, you can play with your friend clicking in "Play", and after click in "start". 

## How it Works

The interface will use one of the words that the players set-up at config page and the player who has the time, can draw what is in the word. After the times is gone the other player can draw your new word.
